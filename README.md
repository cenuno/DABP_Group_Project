### Questions
* What features influence the increase or decrease of corn acreage<sup>1</sup> over time?
    + Our null hypothesis is that the ratio of the corn to soy prices is a key decision factor. Can we reject it?

* If possible, how do weather patterns influence corn acreage over time?

### Data Sets
* United States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency annual crop acreage data for every state from 2011 to 2017<sup>2</sup>.

* National Centers for Environmental Information monthly average temperature from January 2011 to December 2017 for the contiguous United States<sup>3</sup>.

### Required Tasks
* Row-bind the individual .xlsx files from 2011 to 2017 into one master file.

* Inspect features for collinearity.

*	Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand outliers and trends.

* Incorporate weather data for each state as their own features.

### Relevant Models and Evaluation Metrics
*	Create a linear regression model to predict corn acreage for the next year.

* Create clusters based on different crops, states, or years to determine any relevant groups that may be of interest to us to understanding corn acreage growth.
